Warning: layout plan isn't reflective of the final html. It's a plan after all

body is a grid 1x2 (rows x columns) contains sideBar and mainBar

div.sideBar and div.mainBar are column (vertical) flexboxes

div.mainBar contains: headerBar1, headerBar2 and mainContent

div.headerBar1 and div.headerBar2 are row (horizontal) flexboxes

div.mainContent is a grid 2x2, contains yourProjects, announcements, and trending, layout:

your Projects announcements
your Projects trending
(really, line 2 in this grid plays with only announcements and trending)

div.yourProjects is a grid in autofit sizes, contains many card divs

div.announcements and div.trending are column flexboxes.

Each div.trendCard is a grid 2x2 with layout:
profilePic handle
profilePic projectName
